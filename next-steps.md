The following is an overview of RiC-O roadmap and schedule for 2020.

Of course, the schedule also depends on RiC-O users, on their comments, expectations and proposals. RiC-O users now can create issues, and also fork the repository and create pull requests from a fork. 

You can also simply contact us and send comments and questions, using either ([egad at ica.org mailbox](mailto:egad@ica.org), or RiC-O users discussion list. If you would like to subscribe to the RiC-O discussion list, simply email to Florence Clavaud ([florence.clavaud at culture.gouv.fr](mailto:florence.clavaud@culture.gouv.fr)).

The global schedule is the following:

* **preparing and releasing RiC v0.2**. Apart from fixing the possibly remaining bugs in v0.1, this will mainly imply making RiC-O compliant with RiC-CM v0.2 complete version. In this future CM version, some definitions of the already existing components may change, and some new components (attributes and relations) may too. **RiC-O v0.2 should be released this spring**.
* **preparing and releasing RiC-0 v1.0**. This version will not be a draft, but the first official version. **It will be released this fall**, along with RiC-CM v1.0, hopefully at the [ICA international congress in Abu Dhabi (16-20 November, 2020)](https://www.ica.org/en/ica-2020-abu-dhabi-congress).

The following is a non exhaustive list of topics, tasks and known issues on which EGAD RiC-O development team will work in the next months, after having released RiC-O v0.2:

* adding examples and diagrams to RiC-O internal documentation;
* defining more accurately some properties (as transitive, functional, inverse functional...); possibly adding some transitive properties;
* finishing the system of relations (where some subclasses are still missing);
* assessing, and probably changing in some cases, the tense of the verbs in some object properties (e.g. for the properties that correspond to some RiC-CM relations);
* articulating the Event and Activity classes, and the Relation system of classes;
* improving the names of the object properties;
* providing mappings between the components of RiC-O, and the components of the EAD and EAC-CPF XML schemata that archivists use for producing or exchanging finding aids and authority records conforming to the ICA previous standards (ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF);
* adding suggestions of mappings (in rico:closeTo) and OWL equivalences between some classes or properties and components in other models (among which - this is not an exhaustive list- CIDOC-CRM, IFLA-LRM, PREMIS, PROV-O, and Schema.org.
