# Next steps

The following is an overview of RiC-O roadmap and schedule for 2020.

Of course, the schedule also depends on RiC-O users, of their comments, expectations and proposals. In short, it depends on you! Now you can create issues, and also fork and make pull requests. You can also simply contact us and send comments and questions, using either ([egad at ica.org mailbox](mailto:egad@ica.org), or RiC-O users discussion list (if you want to subscribe to this list, simply email to Florence Clavaud (florence.clavaud@culture.gouv.fr).

The global schedule is the following:

* **preparing and releasing RiC v0.2**. Apart from fixing the possibly remaining bugs in v0.1, this will mainly imply making RiC-O compliant with RiC-CM v0.2 complete version. In this future CM version, some definitions of the already existing components may change, and some new components (attributes and relations) may too. **RiC-O v0.2 should be released this spring**.
* **preparing and releasing RiC-0 v1.0**. This version will not be a draft, but the first official version. **It will be released this fall**, along with RiC-CM v1.0, hopefully at the [ICA international congress in Abu Dhabi (16-20 November, 2020)](https://www.ica.org/en/ica-2020-abu-dhabi-congress).

The following is a non exhaustive list of topics, tasks and known issues on which EGAD RiC-O development team will work in the next months, after having released RiC-O v0.2:

* adding examples and diagrams to RiC-O internal documentation;
* defining more accurately some properties (as transitive, functional, inverse functional...); possibly adding some transitive properties;
* finishing the system of relations (where some subclasses are still missing);
* assessing, and probably changing in some cases, the tense of the verbs in some object properties (e.g. for the properties that correspond to some RiC-CM relations);
* articulating the Event and Activity classes, and the Relation system of classes;
* improving the names of the object properties;
* adding suggestions of mappings (in rico:closeTo) and OWL equivalences between some classes or properties and components in other models (among which - this is not an exhaustive list- CIDOC-CRM, IFLA-LRM, PREMIS, PROV-O, and Schema.org.
