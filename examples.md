# RiC-O examples

The RiC-O GitHub repository includes some example (TODO LINK to the giTHUb folder) files. 

For now, they consist of existing, "real world", archival metadata sets (all of them being EAD and EAC-CPF files), and their RDF/RiC-O version. All have been prepared by ICA EGAD. 


They come along with:

* a few introductory notes for each set (in Readme files), including some warnings on the fact that the files are not to be considered uptodate nor representative
* a CC BY 4.0 license
* some additional files: screenshots of some parts of the graphs obtained, examples of SPARQL queries you can use on these RDF datasets.



If you have some, or would like to discuss testing RiC-O on a small subest of your own archival metadata and give free access to the outcomes, contact us ([egad at ica.org](mailto:egad@ica.org)!
