The RiC-O GitHub repository includes some example files (TODO LINK to the giTHUb folder). 

For now, they consist of existing, "real world", archival metadata sets (all of them being EAD and EAC-CPF files), and their RDF/RiC-O version. All have been prepared by ICA EGAD. 


They come along with:

* a few introductory notes for each set (in Readme files), including some warnings on the fact that the files are not to be considered uptodate nor representative
* a CC BY 4.0 license
* some additional files, e.g. screenshots of some parts of the graphs obtained, examples of SPARQL queries you can use on these RDF datasets.



If you have some, or would like to discuss testing RiC-O on a small subset of your own archival metadata and give free access to the outcomes, contact us ([egad at ica.org](mailto:egad@ica.org))!
