## Projects using RiC-O


* A few words on **SNAC** here (Daniel)?
* A few words on **Docuteam software and projects** (Tobias)?
* At the **Archives nationales de France** (ANF)
    * The ANF first built a qualitative **proof of concept**, with two other institutions, the French National Libray (BnF) and a subdivision of the French ministry of Culture (the Service ministériel des Archives de France, SIAF), and a private company ([Logilab](https://www.logilab.fr/)). The target was to demonstrate that it is possible to convert existing archival metadata sets into RDF datasets conforming to RiC-O (in 2017-2018 it was an early version of the ontology), to interconnect the RDF datasets coming from several institutions and to explore and visualize them using new methods. The proof of concept, named **PIAAF (Pilote d'Interopérabiité pour les Autorités archivistiques françaises) was released in February 2028 ([https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr](https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr))**, with a [tutorial](https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr/editorial/help), and [a report on the methodology followed and outcomes](https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr/editorial/contexte-technique). Not only were the results obtained of high quality but the partners were also able to assess the improvement this solution offers in terms of accuracy and search possibilities.
    * The next step is going on. It consists on **moving to a far larger scale**, first converting the whole of the ANF existing archival metadata (finding aids, authority records and vocabularies) to RDF conforming to RiC-O, then beginning to answer the following question: what exactly would it change for the end users, if an archival institution uses RDF/RiC-O datasets and Linked Data technologies for its online information system? The ANF are exploring some leads through several projects. More on this soon. You can already get more information (in French) [here](https://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2167/files/2020/02/20200128_3_RiCauxAN_EnjeuxPremieresRealisations.pdf).

## Tools

* The Archives nationales de France (ANF) and a small private company ([Sparna](http://www.sparna.fr/)) have developed a free software, **RiC-O Converter**, for converting into RDF datasets conforming to RiC-O v0.1 the whole of the ANF EAD 2002 findings aids (about 28.000 XML files for now) and EAC-CPF authority records (about 15.000 XML files for now). This tool is easy to install and use, fast and efficient. Its source code and documentation will soon be released on GitHub. Meanwhile, you can access download the presentation on RiC-O Converter done on January 28, 2020, [here](https://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2167/files/2020/02/20200128_4_RiCOConverter.pdf).
