EGAD has begun to draw some diagrams, hoping that they can help understanding RiC-O as a domain ontology.

You can find them here (TODO LINK to the ad hoc folder in the repo).

They may concern the ontology itself. They also may concern real world examples; in such a case, they represent small graphs (or an overview of them) produced from some existing archival metadata. The diagrams coming from the Archives nationales de France have been used for illustrating a presentation on RiC-O done on January 28, 2020 at the Archives nationales de France. The  [slides that were used](https://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2167/files/2020/02/20200128_2_RecordsInContexts_englishVersionAdded1003.pdf), and are in French and English, provide more information of what the diagrams display.

The diagrams are under a [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

All of them for now have been designed using [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), a free online diagram software. The GitHub repo therefore includes, for each diagram, the XML source file and a JPEG screenshot. If you want to edit a diagram once pulled into your local repository, just open the XML source file in Draw.io! 

If you have some diagrams and would like to share them, just contact us ([egad at ica.org](mailto:egad@ica.org))! We can either list them in this web page and provide a link to your own project or institution repository, or include these diagrams into the GitHub RiC-O repository.
