# Diagrams on RiC-O

EGAD has begun to draw some diagrams, hoping that they can help understanding RiC-O as a domain ontology.

You can find them here (TODO LINK to the ad hoc filder in the repo).

They either concern the ontology itself. They also may concern real world examples; in such a case, they represent small graphs (or an overview of them) produced from some existing archival metadata.

They are under a CC BY 4.0 license (link).

All of them for now have been designed using [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), a free online diagram software. The GitHub repo therefore includes, for each diagram, the XML source file and a JPG screenshot. If you want to edit a diagram once pulled into your local repository, just open the XML source file in Draw.io! 

If you have some diagrams and would like to share them, just contact us ([egad at ica.org](mailto:egad@ica.org)! We can either list them within this page and provide a link to your own project or institution repository, or include these diagrams into the GitHub RiC-O repository.
