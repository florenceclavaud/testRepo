The following is a list of past and future events on RiC-O, from the end of 2019, and of presentations on RiC-O v0.1 that are now available online.

* On **November 22, 2019**, the Adochs project organised an **[international study day on Linked Data](http://adochs.be/linking/)** at KBR (the Royal Library of **Belgium**). While morning presentations tackled new models, those of afternoon presented several case studies on publishing archival data as Linked Data. The first presentation on RiC-CM v0.2 and RiC-O v0.1 took place there. The [slides on RiC, written in English](http://adochs.be/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LinkingThePast_Brussels_20191122_RecordsInContexts.pdf), are less detailed about the standard than the ones mentioned below; however they include some information about the projects lead by the Archives nationales de France.
* On **January 28, 2020**, a conference named **"_Les métadonnées archivistiques en transition : le nouveau cadre normatif, les enjeux et les premières réalisations_" (in English: "_Archival metadata in transition: the new description standard, the challenges and first achievments_")** took place at the Archives nationales de **France** (ANF). The slides used for each presentation can be downloaded from [here](https://labarchiv.hypotheses.org/1495). The [slides about RiC](https://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2167/files/2020/02/20200128_2_RecordsInContexts_englishVersionAdded1003.pdf) are bilingual (French and English). 
* There will be other events on RiC-O in **France** in 2020.
